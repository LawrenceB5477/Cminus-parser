The project is a standard predictive recursive descent parser for the 
C- language that uses a single token of look-ahead. The main 
driving function for the project is the parse function, which 
calls the "program" function which represents the first 
production rule in the context free grammar of the C- language. 
The program uses a global variable named nextToken that contains 
the current token of input being processed, and this token 
is what drives the program. The program uses a function called match that
determines if the token enum passed and the string passed match the current token, 
and if so, advances the current token to the next token. If the 
current token is not matched, the program prints REJECT and exits. 
Each nonterminal of the context free grammar of C- is modeled 
as a function, and the first and follow sets are used to determine 
which production rule to apply for each nonterminal.
